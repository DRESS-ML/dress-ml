# Abstract Syntax

## Metamodel

Usually, the abstract syntax is represented by the metamodels, which are normally based on object-oriented models, such as classes, attributes and associations. Figure below provides a visualization of the high-level specification of the elements of the DRESS-ML syntax using UML class diagrams. These elements are based on the resources listed in the domain analysis presented in last section and represent a set of abstractions to express a model for drone exceptional scenarios.
